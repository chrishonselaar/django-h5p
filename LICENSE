# Licensing

This project contains two distinct components with different licenses:

## H5P Server (`h5p-server/`)

**License: GPL-3.0-or-later**

The H5P server component uses [@lumieducation/h5p-server](https://github.com/Lumieducation/H5P-Nodejs-library) 
which is licensed under GPL-3.0. As a derivative work, the H5P server code in this repository 
is also licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later.

See `h5p-server/LICENSE` for the full GPL-3.0 license text.

## Django Plugin (`django_h5p/`)

**License: MIT**

The Django integration plugin communicates with the H5P server via HTTP API and does not 
incorporate any GPL-licensed code. It is licensed under the MIT License.

See `django_h5p/LICENSE` for the full MIT license text.

---

This dual-license structure allows you to:
- Use the H5P server as a Docker container (GPL-3.0 applies to the server code)
- Integrate the Django plugin into your proprietary Django project (MIT allows this)

The HTTP API boundary between the two components means they are "aggregated" rather than 
"combined" under GPL terms, allowing this licensing arrangement.
